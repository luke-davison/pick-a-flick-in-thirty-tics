# Pick a Flick in Thirty Tics

I think we built this as our Friday group project in week 4.

We had learned how to use React this week and we wanted a chance to use react.

This idea of the project was that it would give you some questions and then pick a movie for you to watch.  Originally we were not planning to use actual movie data but after thinking about it the night before I decided that we should.

So I spent much of the next day building the functions needed to ask the questions.

Everyone else built various components and pages to display the questions.

Then we came together 1.5 hours before the deadline to put it together.

...And we couldn't do it.  Turns out we didn't understand React well enough to get it working.  Also we hadn't yet understood Git well enough to merge our code well.

We ended up standing up in front of the rest of the cohort and teachers and telling them that we had nothing to show.

Lessons were learned.

Later that evening I had some time to kill so I hacked together the working demo you see here to show that our concept worked.  I didn't understand Javascript well enough to get import and export or module.exports working to import my functions so there is a bit of strangeness where some functions appear to be calling other functions that don't exist.

If I have time, I plan to come back and make it prettier.  Also, the huge array of movie information is loaded in full on the front-end.  It is several megabytes.  I probably won't come back and address this but at the time I knew that this was not the best way to do it.
